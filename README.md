If you're a data scientist, installing all the software you need can be quite involved. The goal of the Data Science Toolbox is to provide a virtual environment that will enable you to start doing data science in a matter of minutes. 

Note: The Data Science Toolbox is currently being revived for the upcoming second edition of [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com). Expect many breaking changes in the coming months.
